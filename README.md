-The Next Level button on the Win Scene functionality isn't working. Please try pressing the Home button to return to the Level Picking scene, then continue. The scripts are there, I tried fixing them, but somehow miserably failed.

-Two buttons unlock and lock all levels from top down in the level pick scene, respectively. They are there for debugging purposes only (and cheat~).

-Added some bonus cool sound effects and background music with a small feature.

-A new level scene can be easily created by duplicating a random level scene, then changing the fruit pieces/obstacles' initial spawn position inside the FruitController/GridManager* GameObject.

*Also tile grid size too.

***Note: This one is super faulty, I'm not a puzzle game person nor mobile game developer. I was FORCED to make this.***
