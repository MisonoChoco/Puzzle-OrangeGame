# Unison-Puzzle-OrangeGame-NotForMobile
-The Next Level button on the Win Scene functionality isn't working. Please try pressing the Home button to return to the Level Picking scene, then continue. The scripts are there, I tried fixing them, but somehow miserably failed.

-Two buttons unlock and lock all levels from top down in the level pick scene, respectively, *but require a scene restart by clicking on the home button to return, then going back for PlayerPrefs to update. (tried using PlayerPrefs.Save() immediately upon click, but doesn't work somewhat*

-Added some bonus cool sound effects and background music with a small feature.

-A new level scene can be easily created by duplicating a random level scene, then changing the fruit pieces/obstacles' initial spawn position inside the FruitController/GridManager* GameObject.

*Also tile grid size too.

***Note: The requirements were to make this on mobile, but I have never developed a mobile game before, so of course, I do not know how to port this to mobile. The editor was 2D Mobile Platform, but after trying to test on Device Simulator running iOS, the entire game broke lol.***
