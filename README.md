# Unison-Puzzle-OrangeGame-NotForMobile
-The Next Level button on the Win Scene functionality isn't working. The scripts are there, I tried fixing them, but somehow miserably failed.

-Level button locking is also missing. Will try to make it if I have more time before the deadline.

-Added some bonus cool sound effects and background music with a small feature.

-A new level scene can be easily created by duplicating a random level scene, then changing the fruit pieces/obstacles' initial spawn position inside the FruitController/GridManager* GameObject.

*Also tile grid size too.

***Note:*** The requirements were to make this on mobile, but I have never developed a mobile game before, so of course, I do not know how to port this to mobile. The editor was 2D Mobile Platform, but after trying to test on Device Simulator running iOS, the entire game broke lol.
